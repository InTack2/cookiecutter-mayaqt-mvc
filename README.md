# cookiecutter-mayaqt-mvc
This is an MVC pattern for MayaQt that I made as a trial.

It is also good to fork and modify this cookie cutter template.
Or, we will respond if you request.

## Requirements
Install `cookiecutter` command line: `pip install cookiecutter`    

## Usage
Generate a new Cookiecutter template layout: `python -m cookiecutter git+https://github.com/InTack2/cookiecutter-mayaqt-mvc.git`
